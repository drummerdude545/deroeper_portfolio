Another Page
===============

This is another page that is not a post. Notice there is [no template set](content/another.md) in the meta. Therefore, it shows in the navigation but doesnt show in the blog loop on the homepage. If no template is set, then the default template will be `index.html`

You will notice that this page does not have the blogroll on it because the title of this page is not "Homepage".
